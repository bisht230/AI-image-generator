# AI Image Generator

This project will make use of the OpenAI API to generate realistic images that mimic the appearance of real-world objects, scenes, and environments. The project will involve building a user-friendly interface that allows users to specify the type of image they want to generate, such as landscapes, portraits, animals, or objects. The API will then generate an image based on the user's specifications and display it on the screen. The images generated by the AI will be high-quality, diverse, and unique, offering a new and innovative way of generating images for various applications.
